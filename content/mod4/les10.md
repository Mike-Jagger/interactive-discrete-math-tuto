<h2>Contrapositive</h2>
<p>The contrapositive of a conditional statement <strong>p → q</strong> is <strong>¬q → ¬p</strong>. It switches the parts and negates both. This is the only form that always has the same truth value as the original statement.</p>

<div style="background:#eef; padding:15px; border-left:4px solid var(--primary); margin: 10px 0;">
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p>Original: If it rains (p), then the ground is wet (q).</p>
    <p>Contrapositive: If the ground is not wet (¬q), then it did not rain (¬p).</p>
</div>
