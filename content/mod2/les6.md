<h2>Conditional Statements (p → q)</h2>
<p>Let p and q be propositions. The conditional statement p → q is the proposition “if p, then q.” The conditional statement p → q is false when p is true and q is false, and true otherwise. In the conditional statement p → q, p is called the hypothesis (or premise) and q is called the conclusion (or consequence).</p>
