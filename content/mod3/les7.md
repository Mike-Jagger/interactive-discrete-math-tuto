<h2>Different Forms of Conditional Statements</h2>
<p>Because conditional statements play such an essential role in mathematical reasoning, a variety of terminology is used to express p → q. You will encounter most if not all of the following ways to express this conditional statement:</p>

<div style="background:#eef; padding:15px; border-left:4px solid var(--primary); margin: 10px 0;">
    “if p, then q” <br>
    “p implies q” <br>
    “if p, q” <br>
    “p only if q” <br>
    “p is sufficient for q” <br>
    “a sufficient condition for q is p” <br>
    “q if p” <br>
    “q whenever p” <br>
    “q when p” <br>
    “q is necessary for p” <br>
    “a necessary condition for p is q” <br>
    “q follows from p” <br>
    “q unless ¬p”
</div>
